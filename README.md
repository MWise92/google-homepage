This is my google homepage exercise from The Odin Project course. It's just the basic design. Not very functional. The skills I have demonstrated in this project are...
    building a horizontal nav bar
    centering an image
    building a search bar
    building a sticky footer
Took a crack at it myself based on what I've learned so far from TOP then used dev tools on Google page and youtube videos. Also used WE3 Schools online.
